## Grape Harvesting Robot

This repository contains all implementations as input for grape harvesting robot using ***Image Processing + Clustering*** or ***Deep Learning*** methods.

We also deploy all codes (Deep Learning model) to edge device. It is Jetson Nano (B01)

In this project, we use a stereo camera IMX219-83 to take input images and the most important is to calculate the coordinates (X, Y, Z) in real world from the camera to objects (grapes) using *"stereo vision"*

## Obtained results:
